'''
Names that begin and end with two underscores (__) are reserved for use within Python,
so you should not use them with your own variables
'''

'''
For instance, the name of a function is in the system variable function .__name__, and
its documentation string is function .__doc__:
'''
def amazing():
    '''This is the amazing function.
    Want to see it again?'''
    print('This function is named:', amazing.__name__)
    print('And its docstring is:', amazing.__doc__)


print(amazing())
