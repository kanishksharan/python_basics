#------None keyword--------------
'''
None is a special Python value that holds a place when there is nothing to say. It is not
the same as the boolean value False, although it looks false when evaluated as a boolean.
Hereâ€™s an example:
'''

def is_none(thing):
    if thing is None:
        print("It's None")
    elif thing:
        print("It's True")
    else:
        print("It's False")

is_none("")
is_none("kanishk")
is_none(None)
