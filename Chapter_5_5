defaultdict() is similar, but specifies the default value for any new key up front, when
the dictionary is created. Its argument is a function. In this example, we pass the function
int, which will be called as int() and return the integer 0

d["K"] = 2
print(d['K'])
print(d["A"])
print(d)

print(d.get("A"))

Now, any missing value will be an integer (int), with the value 0:
