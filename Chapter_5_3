'''
Module Search Path

Where does Python look for files to import? It uses a list of directory names and ZIP
archive files stored in the standard sys module as the variable path. You can access and
modify this list.
'''

import sys
for place in sys.path:
  print(place)
  
'''
  That initial blank output line is the empty string '', which stands for the current directory.
If '' is first in sys.path, Python looks in the current directory first when you
try to import something
